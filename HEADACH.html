                <div class="col-md-50   ">
                    <p>
                      Today's technology has brought about numerous advancements and
                      convenience in our daily lives. However, it has also come with its
                      own set of problems, one of which is the headache.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The constant use of electronic devices, such as smartphones and
                      laptops, emit blue light which disrupts our natural sleep patterns
                      and causes eye strain. This can lead to headaches, fatigue, and even
                      migraines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Additionally, the constant stimulation and information overload from
                      social media and the internet can cause stress and anxiety, leading
                      to headaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It's important to take breaks and limit our screen time to prevent
                      these types of headaches. Exercise, meditation, and proper sleep can
                      also help alleviate the symptoms.

                    There are several ways in which technology can be a cause of headaches, including:</p>
                <p>

                    Eyestrain: Prolonged use of computers, smartphones, and other digital devices can cause eye strain, which can lead to headaches. This is because the eyes are forced to focus on a small, bright screen for long periods of time, which can cause the muscles in the eyes to become fatigued.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Blue light: The blue light emitted by digital screens can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle and cause headaches. This is because blue light suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Poor posture: Prolonged use of technology, such as sitting in front of a computer for extended periods of time, can cause poor posture and muscle tension, which can lead to headaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noise pollution: Noise pollution from technology such as smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices can cause headaches.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Stress: Technology can also cause stress and anxiety, which can lead to headaches. Social media and the constant need to check for notifications and updates can create a sense of pressure, leading to headaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lack of physical activity: Spending too much time in front of screens can make people inactive, which can contribute to headaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid headaches caused by technology, try to take frequent breaks, reduce screen time, and adjust the brightness, contrast, and text size on your devices. Make sure you have good posture and take time to do physical activities, and try to avoid using electronic devices before bedtime.
