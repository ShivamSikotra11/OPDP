    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>Tech Infection is a project aimed at addressing the economic and health issues arising due to the high use of technology, including laptops, mobiles, earphones, PCs, etc. in incorrect positions, causing issues like headache, back pain, neck pain, wrist pain, ear pain, eye issues, shoulder pain, and other health problems.</p>
    
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The high use of technology has resulted in various health problems, including headaches, back pain, neck pain, wrist pain, ear pain, eye issues, shoulder pain, and other health problems. These issues can have a significant impact on people's lives, leading to reduced productivity, increased healthcare costs, and decreased quality of life.</p>
    <p>Tech Infection aims to address this problem by promoting safe and healthy technology use. We believe that by raising awareness about the potential health risks associated with prolonged technology use, we can empower individuals to take the necessary steps to protect their health and well-being.</p>
    
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>Our main objective is to reduce the number of cases of tech-related health problems by promoting safe and healthy technology use. We aim to achieve this by educating people about the importance of proper posture and ergonomics when using technology and providing them with resources to help them implement these practices.</p>
    <p>We also aim to raise awareness about the economic impact of tech-related health problems. By highlighting the costs associated with healthcare, lost productivity, and decreased quality of life, we hope to encourage individuals and organizations to take action to prevent these issues.</p>
    
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>Our project is aimed at people who use technology for prolonged periods, especially those who work from home. This includes individuals of all ages and professions who use technology for work or leisure purposes.</p>
    <p>We believe that by targeting this audience, we can make a significant impact on reducing the number of tech-related health problems. By educating individuals about the potential risks associated with technology use and providing them with resources to protect their health, we can help to prevent the negative impact of technology on people's lives.</p>
